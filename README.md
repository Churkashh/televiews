### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Configure proxies**:
   - TeleViews requires proxies. Add your proxies in the `proxies.txt` file in the format `user:pass@host:port`. Example:
     ```
     user1:pass1@127.0.0.1:8080
     user2:pass2@127.0.0.1:8080
     ```

3. Configure settings in `config.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    main:
      threads: 10
      log_proxy_err: false
      proxy_per_view: false
      remove_proxies: false
      detailed_exception_log: false
    ```

   - **threads**: Number of threads to run.
   - **log_proxy_err**: Set to `true` to log proxy-related errors (default: `false`).
   - **proxy_per_view**: Set to `true` to use one proxy per view (default: `false`).
   - **remove_proxies**: Set to `true` to remove used proxies from the `proxies.txt` if proxy_per_view set to `true` (default: `false`).
   - **detailed_exception_log**: Set to `true` for detailed exception logs (default: `false`).

4. Run the tool:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
